# hcl-clj

Convert HashiCorp HCL to Clojure hash map.
Written in pure Clojure, with GraalVM in mind (no Java interop).

``` hcl
job "build" {
  datacenters = [
      "ap-southeast-2"
  ]
  update {
      stagger = "30s"
      max-parallel = 1
  }
  group "load-balancers" {
      count = 1
      restart {
            attempts = 10
      }
  }

```
becomes

``` clojure
{:job
  {:build
    {:datacenters ["ap-southeast-2"]
     :update {:stagger "30s"
              :max-parallel 1.0}
     :group {:load-balancers
               {:count 1.0
                :restart {:attempts 10.0}}}}}}
```
